testdata_decam
==============

This package includes data used by some unit tests
in [obs_decam](https://github.com/lsst/obs_decam).
The data files are edited version of publicly available data
from [NOAO Science Archive](http://www.portal-nvo.noao.edu) and
[DECam Community Pipeline Calibration Files](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/decam-calibration-files),
as well as edited calibration products built from said publicly available data.

* `rawData/raw/c4d_150227_012718_ori-stripped.fits.fz` is taken from [ap_verify_hits2015](https://github.com/lsst/ap_verify_hits2015), with all of the image data set to 0 to reduce file size.
This file contains all HDUs in the original file, and is useful for testing handling of "normal" multi-HDU DECam data.

* `rawData/raw/c4d_150227_012718_ori-stripped-shuffled.fits.fz` is identical to the above except that the HDU ordering has been randomly shuffled.
This file is useful for testing reading of files that may not have the "typical" HDU ordering.

* `rawData/raw/raw.fits` contains the imaging data from two detectors (1 and 25).

* `cpData/` contains DECam Community Pipeline Calibration files (an instcal, a dqmask, and a wtmap).

* `hits2015-zeroed/` contains files from the `ap_verify_ci_hits2015` dataset that have had their image data set to the HDU number and then Hcompressed with `fpack` to reduce their size.
These files are not useful for testing pipelines, but they can be used to test butlers (ingestion and gen2 to gen3 conversion).

* `calibingested/` is a gen2 calib repo linking to the hits2015 calibration files.

* `ingested/` is a gen2 butler repo linking to the hits2015 raw files.

* `pipeline-calibs/` contains a LSST Science Pipelines built master bias frame and corresponding master flat frame.
These were constructed using `cp_pipe`'s `constructBias.py` and `constructFlat.py`.
Both files are for CCD 47, but have had all of the image data set to 0 to reduce file size.
They are used to test parsing of calibration products as part of the gen2 calibration ingestion process.

Gen3 Conversion
---------------
With weekly w_2022_28 + DM-34862 obs_decam, run `./scripts/convert_repo.sh` followed by `./scripts/export_gen3.py`

Git LFS
-------

To clone and use this repository, you'll need Git Large File Storage (LFS).

Our [Developer Guide](http://developer.lsst.io/en/latest/tools/git_lfs.html) explains how to setup Git LFS for LSST development.
